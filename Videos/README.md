A video showing the inference ability of the robot in the simulation using the haptic device Geomagic Touch is presented here:

In this video, we teach the probabilistic lifting primitive to our simulated robotic arm. We start moving the arm thanks to a haptic interface, by holding its dark button.
When the user release the button, the robot reaches the goal ball that corresponds to the initiate trajectory.

A video shows the inference ability of the robot in the offline simulation, with plot representations of the results:
